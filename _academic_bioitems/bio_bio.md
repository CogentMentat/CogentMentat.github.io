I am a PhD candidate in Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington, USA,
in the [Center for Complex Networks and Systems](http://cnets.indiana.edu/). I
research language use with respect to social movements, politics, and group
formation.

* Advisor: [Johan Bollen](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/jbollen/)
* Previous advisor: [Simon DeDeo](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/)

In the past, I helped [smash particles
together]({{site.url}}/projects/p1-FVTX/).

I enjoy making music and music videos.

In the future I will smash data analysis together with text and music to
measure cultural innovation.
